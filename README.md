# boi

"Boi" is the first little game I wrote to gain some more experience with java and the Eclipse IDE.
The code is based on a "Snake"-Game by FoX DeN which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZYVfVxB81s
Although I modified quite a bit you'll surely find great similarities.

The game is very simple: with the arrow keys the player moves a red dot over the screen. He can collect green boxes to gain points. For every green box a number of black dots enters the game from the sides of the screen. That number depends on the level. The black dots chase the considerably faster red dot. If the red dot eventually gets caught the game ends. The red dot can get to another level by collecting yellow boxes which appear less frequent than green boxes.

Since I'm still learning and this projects sole purpose was for me to gain experience don't expect good quality code. Nevertheless feel free to look around it and leave comments.
